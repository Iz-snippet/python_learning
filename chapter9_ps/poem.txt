A whisper rides the evening breeze,
Through silver leaves on twilight trees.
The stars ignite in velvet skies,
Like lanterns born of dreamer’s eyes.

The moon spills secrets on the ground,
Where shadows dance without a sound.
And in the hush, the world feels wide—
A gentle place where hopes can hide.

So wander on, both near and far,
With questions lit by every star.
For though the path may twist and bend,
Each step begins, and is, the end.
